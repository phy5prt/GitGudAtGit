the stakes raised his skill made in quick decisive informed preperations but narrative and
drama demanded events occur before he was ready. He turned them on their heal
and cut their throats. He executed with cleverness as if an accidental parady of truth.

the fall for his audience his people but to more violently united in success were
he successful. The beat to trip would come. In the third chapter the early win

crowd she was the only one who was different yet humility not hubris in not seeking 
such allies would be her fall.
